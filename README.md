# CP317 Beer Finder Web App

## Inspiration:
Inspiration:
Have you ever had an idea of what kind of beer you wanted, maybe a dark yellow beer with a medium body and an approximately 5% alcohol content, but you didnâ€™t know what brand would be best linked to your criteria?

Our web application hopes to solve this by asking for user search criteria and returning a list of beers that match their specifications in order from ***most alike*** to ***least alike***.

## Tools:
#### Front-end:
* **Scripting:** Django templating language (DTL) / JavaScript
* **Structure:** HTML
* **Styling:** CSS / Bootstrap

#### Back-end:
* **Server:** Django
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (built-in with Django)
* **API:** Django GET and POST definitions for accessing/modifying database content
* **Data Structures:** List, Queue, Stack
* **Testing:** PyTest

#### Connection between Front and Back-ends:
* Django has a templating system called Jinga which allows for the dynamic conditional rendering of HTML files
* All CSS and JS files are contained in a special folder named *static* where they can be referenced within the HTML file
* Django is responsible for hosting the web application, accessing and modifying our PostgreSQL database, and with the Django REST Framework extension, it can handle API requests so the front-end client can access/modify data from our back-end
* JS is responsible for further manipulation of the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) that cannot be handed by DTL
* CSS and Bootstrap are used for styling
